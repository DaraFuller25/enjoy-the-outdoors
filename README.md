When doing my 2nd capstone project i was still kind of struggling and asking for a lot of help because i still feel like im not grasping the information. But im really trying my best to to make sure when we doing the last projet i can do much better so i can really make my project stand out and show my improvements. But one of the codes that i like the most would be adding thr gifs to my page i feel like it makes it more fun but i do want to make it look more professional but next time i will work on that but this time i was just playing around with it so i can have a better understanding of eveything
